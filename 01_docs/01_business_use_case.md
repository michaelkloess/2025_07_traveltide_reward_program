## The TravelTide Company â€“ Customer Rewards Program

### ðŸ“š Background
**TravelTide** is a rapidly growing e-booking startup founded in April 2021, known for its industry-leading search and data aggregation technology. 
By offering access to the largest travel inventory in the market, TravelTide has quickly become a strong player in the online travel sector.

While the platform excels in search functionality, it currently faces challenges in customer retention. 
The user experience beyond search has received less attention, resulting in lower return rates among existing customers.

### ðŸ“• Business Focus
To address this, CEO **Kevin Talanick** has prioritized strengthening customer loyalty. 
As part of this strategy, **Elena Tarrant** has joined TravelTide as the new **Head of Marketing**. 
With a proven track record in developing successful retention programs, she brings valuable expertise in creating engaging rewards systems.

### ðŸ“™ Strategic Initiative
Elena is leading the development of a **personalized rewards program** designed to increase repeat usage of the platform. 
The core idea is simple: highlight the specific benefit each customer values mostâ€”such as *free cancellation* or *priority check-in*â€”when inviting them to join the program.

By tailoring communication to individual preferences, the program aims to significantly improve the likelihood of sign-up and long-term engagement.

### ðŸ“— Data-Driven Approach
In close collaboration with the Data Analytics team, the initiative is grounded in evidence-based decision-making. 

The analytical goals include:

- Identifying whether distinct customer segments show consistent preferences for certain types of perks.
- Assigning a likely favorite perk to each customer, enabling personalized and effective outreach.

### ðŸ“Œ Vision
This rewards program combines marketing expertise with data insights to deliver a more relevant, customer-focused experience. 
By aligning incentives with individual needs, TravelTide aims to strengthen loyalty, increase retention, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
