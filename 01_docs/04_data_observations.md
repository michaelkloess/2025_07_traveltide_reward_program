## ðŸ“• Critical Business Observations

### ðŸ“Œ Cancellation Crisis
**Observation:** All 90,670 cancellations involved both flight and hotel discounts

| Year | Cancellations |
|------|---------------|
| 2021 | 3,132         |
| 2022 | 32,700        |
| 2023 | 54,838        |

**Interpretation:** Discount mechanism appears fundamentally broken - discounts correlate with 100% cancellation rate rather than loyalty

**Business Impact:** Critical system failure requiring immediate investigation

### ðŸ“Œ User Growth Analysis

| Year | New Users | Growth Rate  |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 2021 | 75,555    | Baseline     |
| 2022 | 427,441   | +465.84%     |
| 2023 | 517,930   | +21.16%      |

**Observation:** Explosive 2022 growth followed by normalization
**Interpretation:** Temporary market expansion (possibly COVID recovery) without sustained retention

### ðŸ“Œ Pricing Anomalies

**One-way vs Round-trip Pricing:**
- One-way flights: $306 average
- Round-trip flights: $661 average

**Interpretation:** Round-trip bookings are nearly double the price, contradicting typical airline pricing models

### ðŸ“Œ User Behavior Patterns

- 64% of sessions: â‰¤5 minutes
- Peak activity: 6-9 PM daily
- Consistent patterns across weekdays

**Cancellation Demographics:**

- Target segments: Business travelers, luxury travelers
- **Gap:** Limited budget and family options
- **Risk:** Underserved segments may seek competitors

**Hotel Brands by Segment:**
- **Luxury:** Conrad, Fairmont, Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton
- **Business:** Hilton, Marriott, InterContinental, Hyatt
- **Budget:** Best Western, Choice Hotels (limited presence)

## ðŸ“• Data Quality Recommendations

### ðŸ“Œ Immediate Actions Required

1. **Discount System Audit**
   - Investigate why all discounted bookings result in cancellations
   - Review discount application logic and payment processing

2. **Data Validation**
   - Implement checks for flight distances <20km
   - Validate departure/return time equality cases
   - Review hotel stay duration calculations

3. **Market Coverage Analysis**
   - Assess hotel portfolio gaps for budget/family segments
   - Evaluate geographic coverage optimization

### ðŸ“Œ Monitoring Metrics

- Cancellation rate by discount status
- Session-to-booking conversion rates
- User retention across growth periods
- Geographic booking distribution

**Next Steps:** Focus segmentation analysis on high-value, non-discounted users to avoid contaminated discount data influencing customer personas.
