# ðŸ“• Bias Injection Log

**ðŸ“Œ Overview**
This document records potential biases introduced during the data preparation and feature engineering process that may influence customer segmentation outcomes. These biases stem from domain knowledge assumptions and data quality corrections that could affect analytical results.

## ðŸ“• Identified Bias Sources

### ðŸ“Œ Hotel Brand-Based Segmentation Assumptions
**Bias Type:** Domain Knowledge Injection
**Source:** External hotel brand positioning research

**Applied Assumptions:**
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Spontaneous Adventurers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hotel Preference: Wyndham â€“ affordable city hotels, flexible
â”œâ”€â”€ Business Travelers  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hotel Preference: NH Hotels â€“ business locations, MICE-compatible
â”œâ”€â”€ Luxury Travelers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hotel Preference: Aman â€“ luxury, exclusivity, nature
â”œâ”€â”€ Family Travelers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hotel Preference: Marriott (Residence Inn, Autograph Collection with family focus)
â”œâ”€â”€ Budget Travelers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hotel Preference: Choice Hotels (Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn etc.)
â””â”€â”€ Young Travelers
    â””â”€â”€ Hotel Preference: Moxy (Marriott) â€“ young design, events, Instagram-friendly
```

**Potential Impact:**
- **Circular Logic Risk:** Segmentation influenced by hotel brand assumptions may reinforce existing biases
- **Market Oversimplification:** Hotel brands may serve multiple segments simultaneously
- **Geographic Bias:** Hotel availability varies by location, potentially skewing segment distributions
- **Temporal Bias:** Brand positioning changes over time may not reflect historical booking data

**Mitigation Considerations:**
- Validate segment-hotel correlations against actual booking data
- Test segmentation stability with and without hotel brand assumptions
- Consider hotel price ranges as objective alternative to brand positioning

### ðŸ“Œ Airline Booking Pattern Assumptions
**Bias Type:** Transportation Mode Preference Injection
**Status:** Under consideration for implementation

**Potential Assumptions:**
- Certain airlines correlate with specific traveler segments
- Flight booking patterns indicate traveler preferences beyond price
- Airline choice reflects socioeconomic or behavioral characteristics

**Risk Assessment:** 
- **High Risk:** Could introduce demographic and economic biases
- **Low Data Support:** Limited evidence for airline-segment correlations in current analysis

**Recommendation:** Avoid airline-based segmentation without strong empirical evidence

### ðŸ“Œ Data Quality Corrections

#### ðŸ“Œ Hotel Check-in/Check-out Time Correction
**Correction Applied:** Timestamp reordering logic

**Original Logic Error:**
```sql
-- Incorrect assumption in correction logic
CASE
  WHEN check_in_time > check_out_time THEN do not swap
  WHEN check_in_time < check_out_time THEN swap values
```

**Corrected Logic:**
```sql
-- Proper correction logic
CASE
  WHEN check_out_time < check_in_time THEN swap values
  ELSE keep original order
```

**Bias Impact:**
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures logical temporal ordering
- **Stay Duration Accuracy:** Prevents negative night calculations
- **Minimal Analytical Bias:** Correction aligns with business logic

**Validation:** 12,067 records corrected from negative stay durations

## ðŸ“• Bias Mitigation Strategies

### ðŸ“Œ Segmentation Validation
- **Cross-validation:** Test segment stability across different time periods
- **A/B Testing:** Compare segmentation with and without domain assumptions
- **External Validation:** Verify segment characteristics against independent data sources

### ðŸ“Œ Assumption Documentation
- **Transparent Reporting:** Document all external knowledge inputs
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Assess segmentation robustness to assumption changes
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Track segment evolution and assumption validity

### ðŸ“Œ Data-Driven Alternatives
- **Objective Metrics:** Prefer quantitative features over qualitative assumptions
- **Emergent Patterns:** Allow data to reveal unexpected segment characteristics
- **Statistical Validation:** Require empirical support for domain knowledge integration

## ðŸ“• Impact Assessment

### ðŸ“Œ High Risk Biases
1. **Hotel Brand Stereotyping:** May oversimplify customer preferences
2. **Circular Reinforcement:** Using hotel choice to define segments that predict hotel choice

### ðŸ“Œ Medium Risk Biases
1. **Geographic Clustering:** Hotel availability may create location-based segment concentration
2. **Temporal Assumptions:** Brand positioning may not reflect historical accuracy

### ðŸ“Œ Low Risk Biases
1. **Data Quality Corrections:** Technical fixes with clear business logic justification

## ðŸ“• Recommendations

### ðŸ“Œ Immediate Actions
- Validate hotel brand correlations with empirical booking data
- Test segmentation robustness without hotel brand assumptions
- Document all domain knowledge sources and assumptions

### ðŸ“Œ Long-term Monitoring
- Track segment stability over time
- Monitor for bias amplification in personalization algorithms
- Regularly reassess domain knowledge validity

**Next Steps:** Proceed with current segmentation while implementing bias validation tests to ensure analytical integrity and business applicability.
